# Next.js Family & Member Management Application

This is a Next.js project for managing families and their members, featuring a clean, modern interface using React-Bootstrap components for a responsive and user-friendly UI. The backend is integrated with MongoDB for data storage, providing APIs for managing members, families, and other related functionalities.

## Features
- Family and Member Management (CRUD)
- Admin authentication
- Responsive forms using React-Bootstrap
- Sorting, searching, and pagination for member and family lists
- Dynamic field validation
- Integration with MongoDB for backend storage

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nextjs-family-management.git

# Change to the project directory
cd nextjs-family-management

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

---

## Setup

Once you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Create the `.env.local` file**: 
   Copy the provided `.env.local.example` file to create your own `.env.local` file.

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Set the environment variables**:  
   Open the `.env.local` file and update the following fields based on your MongoDB setup:

   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

   This URL should be either from your MongoDB Atlas cluster or from your locally hosted MongoDB instance.

---

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set in the `.env.local` file:

- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string.
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key used for generating JWT tokens for admin authentication.

Example `.env.local`:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/yourDatabaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

---

## Database Setup

If you are using **MongoDB Atlas**, you can follow these steps to set up the database:

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
2. Set up a free cluster and create a user with read/write permissions.
3. Add your local machine's IP address to the whitelist or allow access from any IP (`0.0.0.0/0`).
4. Copy your MongoDB URI to the `.env.local` file.

### If you are using a **self-hosted MongoDB** instance:

1. Install MongoDB by following the [MongoDB Installation Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).
2. Start the MongoDB service and create the required database and collections.
3. Add the MongoDB connection string to the `.env.local` file.

### Initial Database Migration

To initialize the database, including setting up an admin login, run the provided migration script.

```bash
node src/migrations/setupDatabase.js
```

This will:
- Create the necessary MongoDB collections.
- Create an admin user for accessing the system.

---

## Running the Application

After setting up the environment variables and database, you can run the application locally.

### Development

To start the Next.js application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Production

To run the application in production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
